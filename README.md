This is the way that I have configured dwm. Not too much is different from vanilla dwm. 

# Main Config Changes

- I've changed the font to JetBrains Mono. You might want to change this to monospace so it just goes off whatever monospace is on your system.
- The default blue is now orange (in my dmenu build I also have the background set to orange to go with this
- I've added shortcuts for programs I use frequently

# Patches Applied
- Swallow
- Vanity gaps
